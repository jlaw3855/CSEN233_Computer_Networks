Lab 1: Basic Linux, network commands, and C programming skills
Objectives
1. To review Linux/Unix commands.
2. To write sample C programs that demonstrate the use of system calls and files.

Guidelines
For all the labs, you need to develop a good knowledge of Linux/Unix commands and write C in a Linux
development environment. You are highly encouraged to use command-line tools in developing, compiling, and
running your programs. This Lab is designed to familiarize you with the basic Linux commands and programming
skills in C that you will need for the upcoming labs.
Please pay attention to your coding style and good programming practices; if your program is not worth
documenting, it probably isn't worth running.1 Please follow the GNU coding standards available at:
https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Writing-C.html.

In this lab, my task was to write C programs to copy files (binary and text) using both functions and system calls, compile, debug, run, and test. Additionally, I was tasked with calculating the time taken to copy said files using the provided code snippet involving the clock() function from the time.h library. All of these tasks were completed using command-line programs and Vim.
